# Classifying-Song-Genre-from-Audio-Data

A Machine Learning based project to classify the song genre from the audio data.
I have primarily used dataset that consists of songs of two music genres (Hip-Hop and Rock).

The following is the step by step ladder towards accomplishing the same.
1- Training a classifier to distinguish between the two genres based only on track information.
2- Use of `pandas` and `seaborn` packages in Python for subsetting the data, aggregating information, and creating plots when exploring the data for obvious trends or factors you should be aware of when doing machine learning. 
3- Next, Using the `scikit-learn` package to predict whether you can correctly classify a song's genre based on features such as danceability, energy, acousticness, tempo, etc.
